	Chapter 1: intro
* rewrite completely


	Chapter 2: theory
* take whole stack into account (intro, 2.1, add 2.x)
* deemphasize discussion on client types (2.2)


	Chapter 3: implementation
* add section on running in freestanding env (cf. 3.2) and compare to
  hosted envs
* add something about pinning rump kernel cpus to host cores?
  (that still needs some code)
* we cannot assume MMU anymore (3.4), so change discussion
* mention libc (3.6), even though it's slightly on a different layer
* update 3.8 to mention __attribute__((__constructor__)).  also,
  update RUMP_COMPONENT type table (table 3.4 as of now)
* section 3.9 needs a lot of work, e.g. new network I/O drivers (dpdk
  and netmap) and also virtio driver and xen pv i/o drivers.  maybe
  split it somehow?


	Chapter 4: Evaluation
* remove(?)


	Chapter 5: Related work
* integrate relevant pieces into other chapters
* nuke the rest


	Chapter 6: Short history
* mostly done, need to discuss hijack and adjust "rumprun" terminology
  and discussion


	Chapter 7: Conclusions
* done'ish


+ add a whole chapter on build scripts etc.
  (buildrump.sh and friends)
