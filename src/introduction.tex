\section{Introduction}
\label{chap:introduction}

Rewrite whole introduction, motivations have changed too much to tweak
the old one.

\subsection{Book Outline}

\chapref{concept} defines the concept of an anykernel and explains
rump kernels.
\chapref{implementation} discusses the implementation and provides
microbenchmarks as supporting evidence for implementation decisions.
\chapref{evaluation} evaluates the solution.
\chapref{related} looks at related work.
\chapref{conclusions} provides concluding remarks.


\subsection{Further Material}

\subsubsection{Source Code}
\label{sect:src}

The basis of rump kernels is formed by the NetBSD operating system.
For example, the majority of the drivers and the general infrastructure
is directly used from the NetBSD source repository.
The NetBSD files histories are available for study from repository
provided by the NetBSD project, \eg via the web interface at
\texttt{cvsweb.NetBSD.org}.

Additionally, there is infrastructure to support building rump kernels
for various platforms, hosted at \texttt{http://repo.rumpkernel.org/}.

The easiest way to fetch the NetBSD source code is to run the following
commands:

\begin{verbatim}
git clone http://repo.rumpkernel.org/src-netbsd
cd src-netbsd
git checkout all-src
\end{verbatim}

Unlike in the original dissertation, we do not define exact revisions
for the source code we describe in this book.  However, we attempt to
keep all discussion in such a state that it is fully up-to-date whenever
a new version of the book is released.

\subsubsection*{Code examples}

This book includes code examples from the NetBSD source
tree.  All such examples are copyright of their respective owners
and are not public domain.  If pertinent, please check the full
source for further information about the licensing and copyright
of each such example.

\subsubsection{Manual Pages}

Various manual pages are cited in the document.  They are available
as part of the NetBSD distribution, or via the web interface
at \texttt{http://man.NetBSD.org/}.
