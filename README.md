The Design and Implementation of the Anykernel and Rump Kernels
===============================================================

This repository will contain an updated version of the 2012 book _Flexible
Operating System Internals: The Design and Implementation of the Anykernel
and Rump Kernels_.  It is still work in progress and not for distribution.
Meanwhile, read the [original](http://lib.tkk.fi/Diss/2012/isbn9789526049175/isbn9789526049175.pdf).

The second edition will be published as a free-to-download pdf.
Hopefully, it can also be offered as a nominally priced printed
version for those interested in reading a hardcopy.  Please contact
antti.kantee@iki.fi if you have good experiences in
offering tech books via print-on-demand shops.

If you wish to encourage finishing the second edition sooner rather
than later, you can use the link below to donate a sum of your choice
to antti.kantee@iki.fi (the author).  _Donors of 50 EUR and over will be
credited in the book unless they specifically request to be anonymous._
In any case, the second edition will be finished and will be free ("free"
as in "free beer").
