The Design and Implementation of the Anykernel and Rump Kernels
===============================================================

This repository will contain an updated version of the 2012 book _Flexible
Operating System Internals: The Design and Implementation of the Anykernel
and Rump Kernels_.  It is still work in progress and not for distribution.
Meanwhile, read the [original](http://lib.tkk.fi/Diss/2012/isbn9789526049175/isbn9789526049175.pdf).

The second edition will be published as a free-to-download pdf.
Hopefully, it can also be offered as a nominally priced printed
version for those interested in reading a hardcopy.  Please contact
pooka@rumpkernel.org if you have good experiences in offering tech books
via print-on-demand shops.
